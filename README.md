# ELEC5200

This is the CPU I designed in Auburn University's ELEC 5200 (Computer Architecture) Course in Spring of 2021.
It is a Singlecycle 16-bit RISC-V CPU with 16 registers.

You can find the Verilog source code in the src folder, and the Verilog testbenches in the tb folder. The ISA is can be found in the .pdf file (PART 1), which contains the instruction set, register purposes, and instruction encoding. I have also included the block diagram of the datapath which can be found in the .pdf file (PART 2). The unique components were tested and verified using testbenches and Vivado's behavioral simulation feature. The successful outputs are shown in the .pdf file (PART 3).
